#For loops-->repeatable runs through a section of code
#using range() python will halt the loop one number before the final number#ex when looping from 0-5, code will run 5 times but x will only ever be printed as 0-4
#when provided with a single number, range() will always start the loop at 0
# when provided with 2 numbers, the code will loop from the 1st until it reaches one less thant the second number

# loop through a rand of numbers(0-4)
#for x in range(5)
#list(range(5)) will output= [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
#range(2,7)=output 2-6
#ex start with for then iterator
for x in range(5):#indent-->loop is changing each time.
for x in range (2,7):
    print(x)

word = "peace"
for characters in word:
    print(character)
